- lightweight syntax for expressing shell commands, e.g. `sh"ls"`
- typeclasses define how different types are substituted into commands
- compile-time checking of command syntax, with correct handling of quotes and substitutions
- typeclass-based execution strategies for commands
- shell command results may be interpreted as `String`, `Int`, `Unit` or streamed as `LazyList`
- processes may be started synchronously or asynchronously
- commands may be piped to other commands with the `|` operator, or applied like functions
